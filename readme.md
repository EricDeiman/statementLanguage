# StatementLanguage
This is a dynamically-typed language that I played around with that led me to develop my Proto project.

# Driectories
The `abstractmachine` subdirectory contains the code to a virtual machine.

The `common` subdirectory contains code that is common to several of the subsystems used in the project.

The `compiler` subdirectory contains code to generate byte codes for the abstract machine (_i.e._ virtual machine).

The `interpreter` subdirectory contains the code for a tree-walking interpreter.

The 'parser' subdirectory contains the ANTLR 4 grammar for the language.

The `tests` subdirectory contains some tests for the language.

# Note
This code is originally from 2017 that I'm only now putting on GitHub.
